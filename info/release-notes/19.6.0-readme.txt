2D Map
======
There are currently issues with the default map from OpenStreetMap and 
some drag & drop map providers, this will be fixed in the next version.



New   
===

* Tour Tag + Tag Category

  - New text field for tour tag/category which can contain text notes 
    (up to 32k)
  - Tagged Tours view
    - Show tag/category notes in a new tooltip when tags/categories are 
      hovered
    - New column to show tag/category notes
  - Tagging preferences
    - New column to show tag/category notes


* Tour Book

  - Training Effects + Training Performance columns
  - Reimport training values (from .fit + .sml files)

 
* Statistics

  - Training Effects + Training Performance graphs in the new training 
    statistics


* 2D Map (Frederic)

  - Create a tour marker from a location by right clicking on a tour's 
    position on the map
 

* Easy Import (Frederic)

  - When encountering invalid device files, those files are marked to be
    ignored (in the file invalidfiles_to_ignore.txt) so that they are 
    not considered as files to be imported in the future. 
    This feature can be enable/disable in the preferences.

 
Improvements   
============

* Adjust Altitude

  - Whole tour is selected for SRTM adjustments when dialog is opened 
    (previously only half of the tour was selected)


* Import

  - .fit file
    Supported developer fields:
    - Cadence
    - Ground Time (Stance time)
    - Power
    - Elevation
    - Vertical Oscillation
    
  - Suunto 9 (Frederic)
    - Device name is set as Suunto Spartan/9
    - Improvement for cases where a Suunto 9 file is invalid and it 
      should not be read as a fit file
    - Save the tour import file path and file name for each imported 
      Suunto 9 files
    - Detect and save if a heart rate sensor or a power sensor are 
      present

 
* Statistics

  - Show recording/moving/break time separately in the 
    day/week/month/year/training statistics



Bugfix   
======

* .fitlog File

  - Fixed average power issue when value was a floating point
  - Other values will now also be parsed as floating point when integer 
    parsing fails

 
* IllegalArgumentException: Widget has the wrong parent

  - This occured when the app is started and a view was minimized, then 
    the context menu is early created and it has the wrong parent when 
    the view is displayed later on.
    It needed a while until the cause of this issue was discovered, it 
    propably occured after switching to Eclipse 4.
    Nobody complained until now, maybe this feature was not used to 
    minimize a view (this is an Eclipse built-in feature).

 
* File Re-Import (Frederic)

  - Fixed a bug (when using Linux) where the reimport filedialog doesn't
    show

 
* Tour Info Tooltip

  - Fixed max speed for imperial measurement

 
 
Translation    
===========

 - French: completed, improved and fixed translation (Frederic)
 - German
 - Italian (Doriano)

 
 
System   
======
  - FITSDK 20.90
