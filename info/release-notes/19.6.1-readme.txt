2D Map
======

Since a few days, OpenStreetMap do not allow any more the download of 
map tile images as it was done in the last 11 years.

All older version of MyTourbook can not display map tile images from 
OpenStreetMap.

This fix do apply the tile image policy of OpenStreetMap which 
allows again to download map tile images.
