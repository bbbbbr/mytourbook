New   
===

* 2D Map

  - Added/updated/removed 2D Map Provider
  
  - Map provider slideout
   - This replaces the (old and removed) menu dropdown for map provider 
     selection
   - More info is displayed for a map provider which can be configured 
     with the column manager
   - Tooltip for a hovered map provider
   - 3 state column sorting:
     ascending/descending/manual with drag & drop
 
  - Map provider preference page
    
    - More info fields, e.g. online map, category, is layer, contains 
      hillshading
    - All available fields can be displayed in the map provider list and
      can be managed with the column manager
    - A selected map provider in the pref page is immediately displayed 
      in 2D map view


* Weather (Frederic)

  - Added the ability to retrieve the weather data that occured during a
    given tour (using the WorldWeatherOnline API).
  
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
     You need to purchase an API Key to use this feature
  
     This is the first time in the history of MyTourbook that a user 
     needs to pay for a new feature. The problem is, it seems that there
     is no website where you can get historical weather data for free.
  
     Without an API key, any new weather fields can be edited/saved as 
     all other tour fields, they are just not filled automatically.
     
     This API key can be tested 60 days for free, how to use it is 
     documented here.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  - The following data will be set in the tour
    - Label containing the weather description
    - Wind speed
    - Wind direction
    - Average Temperature
    - Wind Chill
    - Max Temperature
    - Min Temperature
    - Humidity
    - Precipitation
    - Clouds
      
  - Moved from 8 cardinals to 16 cardinals wind direction
  
  - The user can choose to activate the weather retrieval in the easy 
    import config
